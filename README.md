# Idiotic-cryptography
DISCLAIMER: 
Hello everyone! My name is Lucas and Im just beginning my journey in data science. Ill upload my ideas here in Github for the sole purpouse of keeping then organized and somewhat uniformly formatted. Those projects arent suppose to work perfeclty or to be top shelf codes, they are mostly ideas that comes to my mind as I learn a new function, sometimes even i need help from Gemini or Claude to make then work, so please keep that in mind if you somehow came across my page and my code.

THIS CODE:
Learning the replace function gave me an idea to use multiple chained replace functions to create a sort of very simple cryptography tool.
